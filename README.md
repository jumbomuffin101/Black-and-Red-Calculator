In this project, I developed a functional graphical user interface (GUI) calculator application using Python and the tkinter library. The calculator performs essential arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, showcasing my programming skills and understanding of GUI development.

Key Features and Skills Demonstrated:

Object-Oriented Programming: I utilized object-oriented principles by creating a Calculator class that encapsulates all functionality, enhancing code organization and maintainability.

Event-Driven Programming: The application is designed to respond to user interactions through button clicks, dynamically updating the display to reflect the current expression.

Error Handling: I implemented robust error handling to manage invalid inputs gracefully, ensuring the application remains user-friendly and resilient.

User Interface Design: The calculator features an intuitive layout, achieved by strategically placing buttons and input fields, demonstrating my ability to create visually appealing applications.

Code Development in VSCode: I wrote and debugged the entire application in Visual Studio Code, leveraging its powerful features for code editing, version control, and debugging, which streamlined the development process.

By successfully integrating these concepts and tools, I created a polished and effective calculator application that reflects my programming proficiency and commitment to quality software development.
